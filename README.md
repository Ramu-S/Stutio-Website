# Stutio-Website

This is the code repository for my photo studio website!

This website is built with a focus on functionality and a visually stunning design thanks to the power of Bootstrap and Node.js.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://your-git-repository-url.git

2. Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

npm install


Built with:

Frontend:
=> HTML5
=> CSS3
=>Bootstrap (version used in package.json)

Backend (Optional):
=> Node.js (version used in package.json)
=> Express.js (if using for server-side functionality)

You can deploy this website to any static hosting platform that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you're using Node.js for server-side functionality, follow the deployment instructions for your chosen framework (e.g., Express.js).
Additional Notes

This is a basic structure, you can add more folders and files as needed for your specific website.
Make sure to replace https://your-git-repository-url.git with the actual URL of your git repository.
Consider adding a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
